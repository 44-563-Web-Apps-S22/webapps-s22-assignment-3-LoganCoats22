        <p>
            I am 21 years old, and am a senior here at Northwest. I transferred in last spring as a Junior from Metropolitan Community Colleges of Kansas City.
            I grew up in Kansas City and graduated from Oak Park Highschool in 2019.

        <h3>Movie: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse</h3>
        <p>
            I like the movie 'Into the Spider-verse' because it tells an interesting story of a character coming into their own, stating that you will never know when you will be ready to take the world on, that it is a leap of faith.
